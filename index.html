    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here! -->
      Our client's name is Juan Juan. He is the CEO of a company called Fanalyze. It is a sports data app that users can 
      use to quickly get relevant information and data with a single search. Users are able to gather data and they're able to compare players and teams, 
      customize their preferences, aggregate data from top sources, and compare advanced stats on NFL, NBA, and MLB 
      but they want to expand their capabilities and provide a service that let's the user follow the olympics with the same enthusiam as NFL, NBA, and MLB play offs.
      We are attempting to provide this service so that the people can quickly gather data about the Olympics, such as the upcoming events, amount of medal counts 
      (for country and athletes), as well as an ability to follow the Olympic torch around the world, being able to compare two athletes side by side, 
      and having the ability to follow preferred events and athletes on social media.    
    </p>
    
    <h3>Scope</h3>
    <p><!-- Change the description of the project strting from here -->
      
        <p><u>Describe the scope of your project.</u><br>
          With Fanalyze being a sports search engine and analysis platform for fantasy sports, sports betting and esports. <br>
          Launching the cross-platform mobile app, Project Javelin, will increase brand recognition and showcase the technology Fanalyze is currently building. <br>
          Project Javelin will integrate data from public and private APIs and social media feeds to provide an immersive, holistic view of the Olympic Games.
        </p>

        <p><u>Which parts of the business problem will be addressed?</u><br> 
          There are too many sources/information for the Olympics. <br>
          Project Javelin will allow users to follow and keep track of their favorite US Olympians along with how the US is doing in the Olympics, all within one application. <br>
          The Fanalyze brand will also be able to capitalize on the popularity of the Olympic games and attract the interest of the Olympic committee to their business.
        </p>

      <p><u>What are the project goals?</u><br>
          The project goals are designing and building an app that allows a user to:<br>
          ● Search for countries and US athletes participating in the Olympics<br>
          ● View medal counts for each country/US athlete<br>
          ● Select 2 athletes for side-by-side comparison/analysis<br>
          ● Live updates for Olympic events and news<br>
          ● View list of events with days and times that can be filtered by country, sport, and athlete<br>
          ● View videos via integration with YouTube<br>
          ● View latest social media posts via integration with Instagram and Twitter<br>
          ● Follow top US Olympic athletes through social media integration <br>
          ● Track the location of the Olympic torch <br>
          ● User accounts (e.g. using OAuth2)<br>
          ● Select favorite sports/athletes to tailor user experience<br>
          ● Voice activation (e.g. for driving)<br>
