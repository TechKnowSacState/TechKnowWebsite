        <!-- Change the description of the project strting from here! -->
        Our client's name is Juan Juan. He is the CEO of a company called Fanalyze. It is a sports data app that users
        can
        use to quickly get relevant information and data with a single search. Users are able to gather data and they're
        able to compare players and teams,
        customize their preferences, aggregate data from top sources, and compare advanced stats on NFL, NBA, and MLB
        but they want to expand their capabilities and provide a service that let's the user follow the olympics with
        the same enthusiam as NFL, NBA, and MLB play offs.
        We are attempting to provide this service so that the people can quickly gather data about the Olympics, such as
        the upcoming events, amount of medal counts
        (for country and athletes), as well as an ability to follow the Olympic torch around the world, being able to
        compare two athletes side by side,
        and having the ability to follow preferred events and athletes on social media.
